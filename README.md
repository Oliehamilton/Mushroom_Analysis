# Mushroom-Analysis
Mushroom Collection and Business Analysis

In this project, I undertook the role of a Data Analyst for a leading agriculture company specialising in mushroom cultivation and sales. The objective was to optimise business strategies by leveraging a comprehensive dataset that details various mushroom types, their characteristics, edibility, and market demand. My analysis focused on improving the company's understanding of mushroom varieties to enhance decision-making.

1.	Data Exploration and Preparation:
  - Conducted thorough data quality assessments and implemented methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.
  - Identified and managed outliers, addressing their potential impact on the analysis.
  - Applied data transformation techniques such as standardisation, binning, and feature engineering to enrich the dataset, providing insightful new features to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
  - Utilised encoding techniques to prepare the dataset for machine learning applications.

2.	Data Visualization and Communication:
  - Generated descriptive statistics for key variables, highlighting trends and variability within the dataset.
  - Developed a series of visualisations, including bar charts, histograms, and box plots, to effectively communicate data distributions and relationships between variables.
  - Provided in-depth analysis and discussion of the visualisations, offering actionable insights for the company's strategic planning.
